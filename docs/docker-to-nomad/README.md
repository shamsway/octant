# Using Claude AI to convert Docker Compose files to Nomad

The prompt and instructions below can be used to convert docker-compose to Nomad job files.

## Prompt

Please convert the following docker-compose YAML to a Nomad job configuration:

```yaml
[Insert your docker-compose YAML here]
```

Consider the following requirements:
Use Podman for running the containers.
Map the services to corresponding Nomad job tasks.
Handle volumes, ports, and environment variables appropriately.
Define appropriate job-level settings, such as job name, datacenters, and constraints.
Add Traefik tags for each service, including the job-specific hostname and other required tags.
Mount volumes exposed to Nomad properly using the 'volume' block in the job definition and 'volume_mount' within the task block.
Set the 'provider' to "consul" in the service definition and configure a health check with a default path of "/".
Ensure the output follows the general structure of the provided example.
Please provide the converted Nomad job configuration in HCL format.
Provide podman commands to run the container from the command line to verify it works when running rootless

## Instructions

To use this prompt:
1. Replace `[Insert your docker-compose YAML here]` with your actual docker-compose YAML content.
2. Provide the prompt to the LLM (e.g., ChatGPT, GPT-4).
3. The LLM will generate the corresponding Nomad job configuration based on the provided docker-compose YAML and the specified requirements.

When you provide this prompt to the LLM, it will generate a Nomad job configuration similar to the one I provided earlier.

Using an LLM prompt allows you to quickly convert docker-compose YAML to Nomad job configurations without writing custom code. However, keep in mind that the generated configuration may require some adjustments based on your specific environment and requirements.

If you prefer a code-based solution, I can provide you with a Python script that demonstrates how to parse the docker-compose YAML and generate the corresponding Nomad job configuration. Let me know if you'd like me to provide that as well.
